### Hi, I'm Chris Hyunhum Cho ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing...

- PhD Studies in Information Security at Korea University, delving into the intersection of Blockchain, Cryptography and Programming Language.
- Building on [Hippo Protocol](https://github.com/hippo-protocol/hippo-protocol), Healthcare Data Protocol powered by Blockchain.
- Contributing Open Sources like [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and [rust-miniscript](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript).


I mostly spend my time in coding, reading papers or books and playing piano :)
